from inspect_ai.dataset import Sample

"""
A sample dataset derived from the gsm8k dataset.

Each sample is the transformation of some sample in the gsm8k dataset where:
- Some speicfic values have been replaced with (upper case) variables.
- The answer has been rewritten as a formula in terms of the variables used.

In some cases grammatical edits have been made, though mistakes present in the gsm8k dataset are kept.
(For example, gsm8k asks "How load does it take to download the file", using "load" rather than "long".)
